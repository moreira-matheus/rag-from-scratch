Our suggestion for today is for you to embark on a 3-hour hike along the scenic path with stunning views of the rolling hills, streams and wildflowers. The trail is approximately 2 miles long, so it's perfect for a leisurely walk at your own pace. We hope this suggestion helps you to appreciate nature in all its glory!\n",

There are several parking lots nearby that you can choose from, but our recommendation is for you to use the one with the best views and facilities. It's located just 15 minutes away from downtown. You'll find it on your left as you approach the town square. If you prefer to walk there yourself, it will take around 30-45 minutes depending on your pace. Enjoy your day!\n",
